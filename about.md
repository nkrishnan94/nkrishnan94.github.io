title: About
---
I am a first year PhD student studying the evolutionary dynamics of microbial biofilms in the [Fusco lab](https://dianafusco.wixsite.com/fuscolab) at the University of Cambridge and [Theory Division](https://www.lerner.ccf.org/thor/scott/lab/) at the Cleveland Clinic Department of Translational Hematology Oncology Research. My research focuses on how mechanical and electrochemical interactions between cells are modulated by external selective pressures. I study these processes primarily through theory and simulations, as well as experiments conducted by the brilliant colloborators with whom I am fortunate enough to work
