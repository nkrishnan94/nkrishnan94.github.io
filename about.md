I am a first year PhD student studying the evolutionary dynamics of microbial biofilms in the Fusco labs at the University of Cambridge. My research focuses on how mechanical and electrochemical interactiosn between cells are modulated by external selective pressures. I study these processes primarily through theory and simulations, as well as experiments conducted by the brilliant colloborators whom I fortunate enough to work with
