This is the first in what I hope will be a series of blogs. And to begin, I wanted to establish somewhat of a focus for these posts. At first glance, this task leaves me at a bit of loss, though. I'm firmly of the belief that doing science is only half (or less) of what will make me a scientist. If no one knows about my work or why its useful or important,  my efforts are rendered futile. So, this blog is my attempt at communicating my science at every stage of development in all of its ugly, messy, unpolished glory. 

Beyond this underlying goal, however, I realize there are near infinite ways to get to achieve this goal. I look at blogs of mentors and colleagues that I've read avidly for inspiration{[1][^2] and come to the conclusion that its best to begin with a commitment to simply get my thoughts out there, perhaps emphasizing frequency over quality in order to get in the groove of converting my disparate thoughts to a coherent, accessible, weekly discourse - to simply build the habit of communicating my scientific (and perhaps other) ideas.

I've decided to begin this week's post with a discussion of where I've been and where I'm headed in the coming weeks, months, and years.


So. I suppose a bit about myself is in order: I'm Nikhil. Im from Cleveland OH, where I grew up, went to high school, recieved an undergraduate degree in physics and a medical degree at Case western reserve University. It was during my time in medical school where I met Dr Jacob Scott who, at that time, was just starting a lab at the Cleveland Clinic [^3]. He gave a lecture to a large group of medical students whom I was among. The lecture was about oncogenesis and the (classic) hallmarks of cancer and though the lecture was informative, thorough, and convincing, little did i know that Dr Scott was simultaneously working to topple the tower that most of this dogma he was espousing was built on.

After the lectures, as students were noisily packing their things and scurrying to their next destinatio, Dr Wcott hastily plugged his research, seemingly in much the same way previous lecturers had, hoping to attract eager med stusents to perform extensive chart reviews or some other task of tedium which often comprised medical student research activies.


It was soon enough clear that what Dr. Scott was offering was a bit different by his mention of something, as I caught 'mathematical modeling’ and ‘physics’ and ‘weird science’ as part of his plug in between the noise of the scurrying student. Though I didn't understand exactly what he did at first glance I had what, looking back, one might call a gut feeling that at the very least, I might learn something interesting if I hung around Dr. Scott. 


Over the next four years I diligently committed myself to medical school course work while filling my nights and weekends with reading seminal popgen papers, reviews on fitness landscapes, and acquainting myself with the field of MathOnco which Dr Scotts work at least in some part fell under. I was eager to wrap my head around all these new ideas, and understand where they fit in, if it all, to what I was learning in medical school

It was during my research period in medical school, a 4 month block in my med school currixulum dedicated for a mentored research project, where I began to home what would become my own research interests. (Sidenote: this was a feature of my medical school curriculum that I am especially thankful for and would encourage ned school applicants to think about this if they even think they may be jnterested in research. Even not its a welcome break from the rest of med schooland at least at my school, the definition of research is broad, i.e. not just cell biology labeatory work).

During this time I began working on a cellular automata simulation of the famous Megaplate experiment [^4], in which Baym et al. demonstrate bacterial evolution to 3000x initial MIC in the order of days, on what is essentially a giant petri dish. Through this project I began to think about how mutations fix in populations, especially those spreading in space. 

Luckily for me many before have also pondered the same questiipn, and it is at about this time I realized I may need years to fully understand this all and successfully apply to my own questions. From there on a desire for my desire for a PhD was birn.

As I still planned to do clinical training afterward and had all ready jnvested four years and A LOT of money in my education it was important that my future path was flexible both in time spent and financially. 

The path I eventually settled on after about 9 months of researching options, talking to mentors, and writing many essays and personal statements, was to have my previous loan forgiven throuh the NIH loan repayment program and my PhD studied at University of Cambridge with Dr. Diana Fusco’s group as well as co-mentored with Dr. Scott. Furthermore I will be the opportunity to have my course funded by the Gates Cambridge scholarship.

I sit now between med school and the start of an exciting period of what I think will be immense personal and academic growth. My research will have the opportunity to take center stage in my life as opposed to a reprieve from pharmaceutical flashcards after sundown. Thought it might bw mundane it is with great prise that science will become my full time kob and I have ben increasingly reflecting on what this means.

Reflecting during this period, as I mentioned before, I have decided that developing my skills as a science communicator will be a crucial and inextricable part of my science training. This brings me to this blog. I plan to begin with more detailed posts on applying for and being awarded the two aforementioned scholarships that will be supporting me though my PhD. I then hope to develop my blog as a place to brainstorm and flesh out my ideas in various stages of development. The first few of such posts I hope will be a more detailed discussion of my MegaPlate simulations, population dynamics during spatial spreading, and ideas surrounding evolutionary dynamics biofilm which, for now, will form the bulk of my PhD work. I am excited for both the journey ahead and the opportunity to share it through this blog. Thanks for reading
