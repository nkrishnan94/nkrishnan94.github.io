This is the first in what I hope will be a series of blogs. And to begin, I wanted to establish somewhat of a focus for these posts. At first glance, this task leaves me at a bit of loss, though. I'm firmly of the belief that <i>doing</i> the actual science is only half (or even less?) of the job. If no one knows about my work or why it's useful or important, could it ever actually be useful or important? So, this blog is my attempt at communicating my science at every stage of development in all of its ugly, messy, unpolished glory. 

Beyond this underlying goal, however, I am not sure exactly how this will look. Examining blogs of mentors and colleagues that I've read avidly for inspiration[^1][^2], I have come to the conclusion that its best to begin with a commitment to simply get my thoughts out there, perhaps emphasizing frequency over polish or completeness in order to get in the groove of converting my disparate thoughts to a coherent, accessible, weekly discourse, to simply build the habit of communicating my scientific (and perhaps other) ideas.

I've decided to begin this week's post with a discussion of where I've been and where I'm headed in the coming weeks, months, and years.

I suppose a bit about myself is in order: My name is Nikhil Krishnan. I'm from Cleveland OH, where I grew up, received an undergraduate degree in physics and a medical degree at Case Western Reserve University. It was during my time in medical school where I met [Dr. Jacob Scott](https://twitter.com/CancerConnector) who, at that time, was just starting a [lab at the Cleveland Clinic](https://www.lerner.ccf.org/thor/scott/lab/). He gave a lecture to a large group of medical students, which I was a part of. The lecture was about oncogenesis and the (classic) hallmarks of cancer, and though the lecture was informative, thorough, and convincing, little did I know that Dr. Scott, who I would later call Jake at his insistence, was simultaneously working to topple the tower that much of the dogma he was teaching was built on.

After the lectures, as students were noisily packing their things and scurrying to their next destination, Jake hastily plugged his research, seemingly in much the same way previous lecturers had, hoping to attract interested eager med students. 

Though I had no interest in doing clinical chart reviews at this point, it was soon enough clear that what Jake was offering in his lab was a bit different by his mention of 'mathematical modeling’ and ‘physics’ and ‘weird science’ as part of his plug, which were really the only parts of it I heard over the bustle of colleagues. Though I didn't understand exactly what he did at first glance I had what looking back one might call a gut feeling that, at the very least, I might learn something interesting if I hung around Jake.

Over the next year I diligently committed myself to medical school course work while reading whatever Jake suggested, which consisted of seminal population genetics papers, reviews on fitness landscapes, the subject of my initial project with Jake, and acquainting myself with the field of MathOnco which Dr Scotts work, at least in some part, fell under. I was eager to wrap my head around all these new ideas, and understand where they fit in, if it all, to what I was learning in medical school.s

It was during my research period a year in a half later which was a 4 month block in my med school curriculum dedicated for a mentored research project, where I began to hone what would become my own research interests. (Sidenote: this was a feature of my medical school curriculum that I am especially thankful for and would encourage ned school applicants to think about this if they even think they may be interested in research. Even if not it's a welcome break from the rest of med school and at least at my school, the definition of research is broad, i.e. not just cell biology laboratory work, for instance). During this time I began working on a cellular automata simulation of the amazing Megaplate experiment [^3], in which Baym et al. demonstrate bacterial evolution to 3000x initial MIC in the order of days, on what is essentially a giant petri dish. Through this project I began to think about how mutations fix in sub-populations that comprise some meta-population population, especially those spreading in space. 

Luckily for me many before have also pondered related questions, and it is at about this time I realized I may need years to fully understand this all and successfully apply to to my own questions. From there on a desire for my desire for a PhD was born. I was initially unsure how to best proceed, however. This was not something my med school deans commonly mentored students through.

As I still planned to do clinical training afterward and had all ready jnvested four years and A LOT of money in my education, it was important that my future path was flexible both in time spent and financially. 

After ~ 9 months of researching options, trying for some options that didn't work out, talking to mentors, giving up, crying, trying some more, lots of google, and writing many essays and personal statements, I found my way. The solution I settled on was to have my previous loan forgiven through the [NIH loan repayment program](https://www.lrp.nih.gov/) and study for my PhD at University of Cambridge with [Dr. Diana Fusco’s group](https://dianafusco.wixsite.com/fuscolab) as well as co-mentored with Jake. Furthermore, I am fortunate to have the opportunity to be funded by the [Gates Cambridge scholarship](https://www.gatescambridge.org/).

I sit now at the very beginning of an exciting period of what I think will be immense personal and academic growth. My research will finally  take center stage in my life as opposed to a reprieve from pharmaceutical flashcards after sundown. Thought it might sound mundane or oddd, it is with great pride that science will become my full time job and I have been increasingly reflecting on what this means.

Reflecting during the period between medical school and my PhD, as I mentioned before, I have decided that developing my skills as a science communicator will be a crucial and inextricable part of my science training. This brings me to this blog. I plan to begin with more detailed posts on applying for and being awarded the two aforementioned scholarships that will be supporting me though my PhD. I then hope to develop my blog as a place to brainstorm and flesh out my ideas in various stages of development. The first few of such posts I hope will be a more detailed discussion of my MegaPlate simulations, population dynamics during spatial spreading, and ideas surrounding evolutionary dynamics biofilm which, for now, will possibly form the bulk of my PhD work. I am excited for both the journey ahead and the opportunity to share it through this blog. Thanks for reading
